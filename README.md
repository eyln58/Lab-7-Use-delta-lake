# 🔁 Lab 3: Delta Lake and Streaming in Azure Synapse Analytics

## Overview

This lab focused on provisioning a full **Azure Synapse Analytics workspace** and performing **Delta Lake operations** using Apache Spark notebooks in Synapse Studio. It also introduced **streaming data ingestion** into Delta tables, simulating IoT device data.

## 🧠 What I Did

- 🚀 **Provisioned a Synapse workspace** using PowerShell and ARM templates  
- 📁 **Explored Delta Lake support** in Synapse with CSV data stored in Azure Data Lake  
- 🧪 **Created Delta tables** and worked with:
  - External tables
  - Managed tables
  - SQL catalog tables
- 🔄 **Used time travel** and **table history tracking** with Delta Lake  
- 🌐 **Simulated IoT streaming data** and stored it in Delta tables using Structured Streaming API  
- 🔍 **Queried Delta tables using serverless SQL pools** for analytics

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Azure Synapse Analytics  
- Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- Delta Lake  
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2  
- Serverless SQL Pools  
- Structured Streaming API

## ✅ Key Learnings

- How to manage and query **Delta Lake** tables in Synapse  
- Streaming data ingestion with **Spark Structured Streaming**  
- Differences between **managed** and **external** Delta tables  
- Querying Delta tables via **serverless SQL pools**
